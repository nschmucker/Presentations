## The Analyst Code presentations repository

The links below will take you to online slide presentations used to accompany YouTube videos or website posts (or both!). For more information about how to create presentations like these and share them online, check out this beginners’ [reveal.js tutorial](https://github.com/nschmucker/Presentations). Everything here is open source, meaning you can take a look to see how I created it! The raw source material is all on my public [GitHub repository](https://github.com/nschmucker/Presentations).

Visit my [YouTube channel](https://github.com/nschmucker/Presentations) for instructional videos.
